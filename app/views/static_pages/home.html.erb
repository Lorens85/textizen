		  	What if City Hall could open its ears to many more people? With Textizen, all you need is an opinion, a minute, and a cell phone that can handle text messages.
		  	<br>
		  	<br>
		  	<!--Current city planning efforts mainly rely on in-person meetings for neighborhood feedback. For many citizens, logistics and time commitments prevent them from attending.
		  	<br>
		  	<br>
		  	-->
		  	How Textizen can help:
		  	<ul>
			  	<li>Quantitative data for decision-making</li>
			  	<li>More representative voices</li>
			  	<li>Provide guidance on topics to discuss at in-person meetings</li>
		  	</ul>
