Hey, love the library, but having some issues with nesting on [this project](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/tree/followups-simpleform)
Don't think it's necessarily an issue with the library, but my head is spinning so thought I'd post in case you had any ideas!

Here's the hierarchy:

[Poll](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/models/poll.rb) ([form](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/views/polls/_form.html.erb)) `has_many` [Questions](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/models/question.rb) ([form](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/views/polls/_question_fields.html.erb)) `has_many` [Options](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/models/option.rb) ([Form](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/views/polls/_option_fields.html.erb)) `has_one` Follow-up, class: Question ([Form](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/views/polls/_follow_up_fields.html.erb)) `has_many` Options ([Form](https://github.com/codeforamerica/textyourcity/blob/followups-simpleform/app/views/polls/_follow_up_option_fields.html.erb))

UI renders fine, but issues arise editing objects with followups, or creating items with follow-up-options (the two deepest levels of nesting)

#### 1-  The most serious issue, When creating a poll: Unable to create more than one follow-up option. Everything looks fine in the UI, but only one follow-up-option gets posted and saved
  
  When attempting to create a poll with the following structure
  	
		Question, text: "First question" type "MULTI" 
			option, label: apples, value: a
			option, label: bananas, value: b
				Follow-up question, text: "Are you sure?", type: "YN"
					option: yes
					option: no
		
This is what gets `post`ed

#### 2-  When editing: Can't edit any poll that has follow-ups. When attempting to edit, it seems follow-ups are being deleted. In the below log, questions_all graps all the questions for a poll, including for any followups

I'm pretty much out of ideas, my next step was to create a separate follow-ups table (or try using Single Table Inheritance to emulate it) and see if that fixed anything...
Thanks again!



updates:

Some updates. 

For issue #2. If I remove `:dependent => :destroy` from the `Option has_one follow-up` relationship I get this error. _option_fields.html.erb:11 is "link_to_add_association :follow_up"

		ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved in PollsController#edit

		Failed to remove the existing associated follow_up. The record failed to save when after its foreign key was set to nil.
		Rails.root: /Users/ayule/code/txtyourcity_rails

		Application Trace | Framework Trace | Full Trace
		app/views/polls/_option_fields.html.erb:11:in `_app_views_polls__option_fields_html_erb___3590358424531303420_70248388674980'

Seems the issue is due to follow_up being a `has_one` relationship. Upon editing, `link_to_add_association` tries to destroy the follow_up (if able).
Everything seems to work fine once I switch it to a `has_many`. So I guess this becomes a feature request for support of has_one relationships!

Issue #1 is still unresolved... if it would be helpful I could spin up a demo instance of the app and send over the link!
